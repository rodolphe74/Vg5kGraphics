An [EF9345](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomson_EF9345) Quest !

Or how to display full screen image on a [VG5000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_VG5000).

You like programming with constraints? You will love the following. The best you can do to display image on this machine is to the semi graphic quadrichomic mode which allows you to:
- redefine a maximum of 500 quadrichomic characters.
- a quadrichomic character as a size of 4x10 px.
- each row contains contains 40 characters
- for 25 rows
- which allows a resolution of 160*250 px
